## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ESM), Bootstrap 5
-   **Backend & Database:** Google Firebase
    -   **Authentication:** For user registration and login.
    -   **Firestore:** As the NoSQL database for all application data.
    -   **Hosting:** For cloud deployment.

---

## System Architecture

The system uses a client-server architecture where the frontend client communicates directly with Firebase services.

-   **Client (Browser):** A static web application built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. All dynamic behavior is handled by modular JavaScript.
-   **Backend (Firebase):** Google Firebase provides the backend-as-a-service. It handles user identity and stores data in Firestore collections.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
-   A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
-   A Google account to create a Firebase project.

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vinodhacker17/Student-teacher-appointment-system.git
    cd Student-teacher-appointment-system
    ```

2.  **Set up your Firebase Credentials:**
    -   In the Firebase Console, create a new project and then create a **Web App**.
    -   Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object.
    -   In the project folder, create a new file named `firebase-config.js`.
    -   Copy the following code into your new `firebase-config.js` file and paste your credentials into the `firebaseConfig` object.
        ```javascript
        // firebase-config.js
        import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.12.0/firebase-app.js";
        import { getAuth } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.12.0/firebase-auth.js";
        import { getFirestore } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.12.0/firebase-firestore.js";

        // IMPORTANT: Paste your own Firebase config object here
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
        };

        const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        const auth = getAuth(app);
        const db = getFirestore(app);

        export { auth, db };
        ```
    *This file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be pushed to GitHub, keeping your keys safe.*

3.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    -   In your Firebase project console, go to **Authentication** and enable the **Email/Password** sign-in provider.
    -   Go to **Firestore Database** and create a database. Start in **test mode** for easy setup.

4.  **Run the Project:**
    -   Use a live server extension in VS Code to open `index.html`.
